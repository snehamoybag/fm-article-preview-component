# fm-article-preview-component
This is my coding solution to the Article Preview Component Challenge from Frontendmentor.io
This project looked simple when decided to take the challenge, but boi 😬 although it looks simple, it has some small components that definitely requires some time and thinking to complete. Definitely learnt more about css absolute and relative positioning and how to ignore overflow hidden of the parent element 😊 This is my first time using css animations so they are not that advance 😅 but i did my best to make it look clean and natural 😃👍
